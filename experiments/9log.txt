Observation (regarding problem 3):
[8 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0] (7 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) 1 suggestion 4: should work (checked all 3 options)

[9 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0] (7 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) 1 suggestion 6: is not winning
as (15 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0] is algorithmically good.

What if 1 and then 2 is presented from  [9 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0] (7 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) ?

* [10 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0] should be easy.

but not if you send 4 (!)

* [9 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0] (8 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) 2 is winning if you send 4

  but [09 04 03 02 01 00 00 00 00] (08 01 00 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00) 04 takes some 240 seconds!

Still to check:

[8 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0] (7 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) suggestion 4 does not work generally.

Problem 8:

* [5 4 1 1 1 0 0 0 0] (7 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) 1 has 43967 tasks

-- it seems to be cut too early.
   Even [5 4 4 1 1 0 0 0 0] (8 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) 2 is slow.

In fact, for 8 bins, [5 4 4 1 1 0 0 0] (8 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) 2
is winning for alg, so the lower bound avoids this situation on purpose.

In fact, this is one of the reasons why just sending 8 ones is not right.
