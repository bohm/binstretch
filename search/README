To compile, you need a modern C++ compiler, such as recent g++ with -std=c++17.
You also require an OpenMPI installation.
Steps:

1. In common.hpp, set up the desired constants.
2. In server_properties.hpp, set up the capabilities of your computers.
2. Compile the program: "mpic++ -Wall -O3 -std=c++17 main.cpp -o lb-45_33 -pthread -latomic"
3. Run the program according to your network setup, e.g. "mpirun -np 2 ./lb-45_33"
